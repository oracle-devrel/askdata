## Oracle Digital Assistant (ODA)

### ODA Setup – Provision ODA Instance

### Prerequisites 

This section assumes the following resources are configured: 
* [IDCS Application](./business_idcs.md)
* [Engine Application](./nl2sql_engine.md)
* [API Gateway](./business_api_gateway.md)

#### Provision ODA Instance

1. Sign in to your Oracle Cloud account.

2. In the Infrastructure Console,
    click !["Navigation menu icon"](./business_media/media/image36.png) on the top left to open the navigation menu, select **Analytics & AI**,
    and select **Digital Assistant** (which appears under the **AI Services** category on the page).

3. From the **Compartments** panel, select a compartment.
4. Click **Create Digital Assistant Instance**.
5. On the **Create Digital Assistant Instance** page, fill in the following details:
    - **Compartment**. 
    - **Name**. Enter a name that reflects usage of the instance. For
      example, for a development environment, genai-nl2sql-dev
    - **Instance shape**. Select between the following shapes:
      - **Development**. This is a lightweight option that is geared
        toward development work.
      - **Production**. This option should be selected for production
        instances of Digital Assistant. In comparison with the
        Development shape, this option has higher rate limits and
        greater database capacity, which enables more Insights data to
        be collected.

6. Click **Create**.

7. After a few minutes, your instance will go from the status
    of Creating to Active, meaning that your instance is ready to use.

### Deploy ODA Code – REST APIs

#### Import REST APIs

1. Sign in to your ODA console.

    - Next click on “settings” as shown below

- After import, for each of them, point them to api gateway url (do not
  change the trailing part of the URL like /v1/prompt in the example below)

![](./business_media/media/import-rest-services.png)

#### Select the location of API Gateway url

Token Endpoint URL: \<IDCS base url\>/oauth2/v1/token
Authorization Endpoint URL: \<IDCS base url\>/oauth2/v1/authorize

Client ID: \<Client Id from the IDCS confidential app\>
Client Secret: \<Client Secret from the confidential app\>

Scopes: urn:opc:idm:__myscopes__

Subject Claims: sub

Refresh Token Retention Period: 7
```

> **Note** If your idcs app is using a custom scope, use that scope instead e.g. odatest

- Provide Client ID of IDCS & secret from IDCS confidential app below

![](./business_media/media/new-auth-service.png)

![](./business_media/media/new-auth-service-2.png)

> **Note** The scope will be the audience + scope defined in [Deploy IDCS Application](./business_idcs.md#adding-scopes) e.g. odatest

### Deploy ODA Code – Skill

#### Import ODA Skill

1. Sign in to your ODA console.

    - Click Development -\> Skills

![](./business_media/media/image47.png)


2. Click “Import Skill” (located right top corner):

![](./business_media/media/image48.png)


3. Zip and Import the skill provided in nl2sql-main/vbcs_oda_archives/oda/askdata-oda-base folder in the code:

> **Note** The skills *oda-skill-EmbeddedCont* & *oda-skill-ExtOracleFn* are provided as a reference, in case you'd like to deploy the custom componet as an oracle function. If you would like to deploy the component as a function, see [Deploy Function Application](../deployment/function.md).

For these instructions we'll be using the askdata-oda-base skill.

- Navigate to [askdata-oda-base directory](../../../vbcs_oda_archives/oda/askdata-oda-base/)

- Run the following 

```bash
zip -r genaisqlskill.zip .
```

- In ODA, navigate to Development > Skills > Import Skill

- Upload zipped skill

![](./business_media/media/image49.png)


- After the skill is imported, you should see following under the list
  of skills: (actual name may differ)

![](./business_media/media/image50.png)


- Next Navigate your Skill

![](./business_media/media/image51.png)


- Go back to your skill and Train

#### Confirm queryBackendService Custom Component is Deployed

1. Navigate to custom components and check to see if the custom component is deployed 

![Custom Component](../deployment/oda/custom-component.png)

2. If the custom component failed to deploy, navigate to [queryBackendSvc](../../../vbcs_oda_archives/oda/queryBackendSvc/) under /vbcs_oda_archives/oda and run 

```bash 
bots-node-sdk pack
```

> **Note** If bots-node-sdk is not installed on your machine, run the following:
